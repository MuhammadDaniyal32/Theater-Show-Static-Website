        <p>A stage adaptation of the classic British sitcom Only Fools and Horses, co-written by Paul Whitehouse, is set
          to open in London's West End at the Theatre Royal Haymarket in 2019. <br><br>

          First broadcast on the BBC in 1981, Only Fools and Horses was the quintessential British comedy show. Starring
          David Jason as South London market trader Derek ‘Del Boy’ Trotter and Nicholas Lyndhurst as his younger
          brother Rodney, the Peckham brothers spent their lives trying to get rich quick with a number of schemes
          devised through their company, Trotters Independent Trading Co. Their yellow three-wheeler Reliant Regal is an
          icon and can be spotted on the odd road across Britain if you’re lucky…<br><br>

          This new musical, co-written by comedian Paul Whitehouse and son of show's creator, John Sullivan, this
          production will put these legendary characters onto the West End stage for the very first time. The story will
          revolve around Del Boy looking for love, Rodney preparing for his marriage to Cassandra, and Grandad taking
          stock on his life.<br><br>

          Only Fools and Horses will star Paul Whitehouse as Grandad, Tom Bennett as Del Boy and Ryan Hutton as Rodney.
          It will also have songs by Whitehouse and Jim Sullivan, with additional music by John Sullivan and Chas Hodges
          (of Chas & Dave, who wrote the original theme tune).</p>

          <p id="text">Broadcasting for seven series until 1991, Only Fools and Horses contained some of British
            comedy’s funniest gags, including Del Boy’s iconic fall through the bar sketch, the brothers’ run through
            the streets dressed as Batman and Robin, or any scene involving their friend Trigger, Only Fools and Horses
            is loved by millions across the UK.<br><br>

            Only Fools and Horses also starred Lennard Pearce as Grandad, Buster Merryfield as Uncle Albert, Tessa
            Peake-Jones as Del Boy’s love Raquel and John Challis as snobby car salesman Boycie.<br><br>

            The series originally ran for 10 years with a number of specials, and spawned two BBC spin-offs: The Green
            Green Grass focused on the life of Boycie and his family in the countryside, and Rock and Chips, a prequel
            written by Only Fools and Horses creator John Sullivan in 2010.<br><br>

            Only Fools and Horses tickets for the West End are available now. </p>
