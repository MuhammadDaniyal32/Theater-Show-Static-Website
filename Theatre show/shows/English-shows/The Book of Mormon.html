        <p>Written by the creators of the cult TV hit South Park, The Book of Mormon has been playing in the West End at
          the Prince of Wales Theatre since 2013. It has fully established itself as one of London’s most popular
          musicals and one of the hottest tickets in town. Heralded "the best musical of the century" by the New York
          Times when it opened on Broadway in 2011, Mormon arrived in London to instant success, winning four Olivier
          Awards including Best New Musical.<br><br>

          Initially running at the Eugene O'Neill Theatre in New York, The Book of Mormon broke box office records at
          the theatre and won 9 Tony Awards from 14 nominations, including Best New Musical, Best Original Score, Best
          Book of a Musical and Best Direction of a Musical. The show made the leap across the pond in 2013 and has been
          delighting audiences at the Prince of Wales with its crude, witty satirical humour.<br><br>

          The Book of Mormon has book, music and lyrics by South Park creators Matt Stone and Trey Parker, and the mind
          behind the hit musical Avenue Q, Robert Lopez. Development of the show began in 2003 when Parker and Stone
          were noticed by Lopez in the audience of a performance of Avenue Q. They went for drinks and quickly conceived
          the idea of writing a musical based around Joseph Smith, the founder of the Church of Latter Day Saints.</p>
        <div>
          <p id="text">The show follows the journey of two Mormon missionaries who travel to Africa to preach their
            religion. They share their scriptures with a small village in Uganda, but find it difficult to interest the
            locals who have much bigger things to worry about: AIDS, famine, and local warlords. It features hilarious
            songs like “Hello”, “All American Prophet”, “I Believe” and “I Am Africa”.<br><br>

            Choreography for The Book of Mormon is by Casey Nicholaw, who co-directs the show with Parker. Nicholaw is
            renowned in musical theatre and his work is currently also on display in the West End production of Aladdin.
            He is known for his high energy production numbers and unique skill at staging musical comedy.<br><br>

            Wales Theatre, today. </p>
