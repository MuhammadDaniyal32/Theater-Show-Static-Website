        <p>Broadway legend Patti LuPone returns to London in a new gender-reversed production of Stephen Sondheim and
          George Furth's 1970 musical Company. The musical opened in London's West End at the Gielgud Theatre, produced
          by Elliott Harper Productions, a new production company set up by director Marianne Elliott and theatre
          producer Chris Harper.<br><br>

          Rosalie Craig stars in the central role of 'Bobbie' in this gender-reversed production that has been blessed
          by Sondheim - the first production to be allowed to change the gender of the characters. Patti LuPone will
          play Joanne. <br><br>

          Patti LuPone has played some of musical theatre's greatest characters, including Fantine in Les Miserables in
          London and Eva Peron in Evita on Broadway. She has also starred as Norma Desmond in Sunset Boulevard, and in
          Sondheim's musicals Gypsy and Sweeney Todd. She most recently starred in War Paint on Broadway, which closed
          in November 2017.</p>
        <div>
          <p id="text">Rosalie Craig is known for her work in musical theatre including the world premiere of Tori
            Amos's musical The Light Princess at the National Theatre in 2013, for which she was nominated for an
            Olivier Award. Other credits include City of Angels (Donmar Warehouse), Finding Neverland (Leicester Curve),
            Ragtime (Regent's Park Open Air Theatre) and London Road at the National Theatre.<br><br>

            The original production opened on Broadway at the Alvin Theatre on 26 April 1970, where it went on to run
            for 705 performances and was nominated for a record-setting fourteen Tony Awards, winning six, including
            Best Musical. The original West End production of Company opened on 18 January 1972, at Her Majesty's
            Theatre, where it went on to run for 344 performances and reuniting the original cast including Larry Kert,
            Elaine Stritch, Joy Franz, and Donna McKechnie.<br><br>

            Company has since been revived numerous times in London and New York and is one of Sondheim's most
            frequently performed musicals. A London revival was mounted at the Donmar Warehouse in 1995 directed by Sam
            Mendes which later transferred to the Albery Theatre (Noel Coward) for a limited run in 1996. Adrian Lester
            starred in the lead role of Bobby.</p>
